# Timeline
* [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) (c. 9431 – c. 9506 HE), wrote a [musical composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis) based on astronomical observations of the orbital behaviours & patterns displayed by nearby planetary objects.
* [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid) (fl. 9701 HE), wrote the single most authoritative textbook on mathematics; [Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements) (c. 9701 HE), it's like the bible of mathematics.
* [Aryabhata I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata) (10476 – 10550 HE), developed the place-value notation in the 5th century.
* [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta) (c. 10598 – c. 10670 HE), standardised the symbolic representation for zero in the 6th century.
* [Leonardo Bonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) (c. 11170 – c. 11250 HE), known for the fibonacci sequence, although he was not the first to discover it.
* [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) (between 31 October & 6 December 11607 – 12 January 11665 HE), wrote a lot of marginal proofs.
* [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) (25 December 11642 – 20 March 11726/7 HE), boasted about his calculus to Leibniz.
* [Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) (1 July 11646 – 14 November 11716 HE), developed his own calculus from scratch after Newton bragged about his own; it was far better than Newton's, and we still use it to this very day.
* [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) (15 April 11707 – 18 September 11783 HE), the master of us all.
* [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (22 December 11887 – 26 April 11920 HE), knew numbers very well; [1729](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_%28number%29).
